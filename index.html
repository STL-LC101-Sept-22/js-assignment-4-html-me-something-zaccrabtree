            <p>In 2015, I was a married father of three whose main hobby, other
            than home schooling, was singing in my acapella Russian Church choir. I had a love
            for all things Russian and musical, but my economic and family situation seemed to
            rule out any sort of excursion there for the foreseeable future.</p>
            <p>That fall, however, I learned of a Russian choral institute for Russian-American
            church singers called the Patriarch Tikhon Russian-American Music Institute 
            (<a href="https://patraminstitute.org/"><b>PATRAM</b></a>),
            which held a masterclass in Moscow every year for church musicians. I was simultaneously
            elated and dejected: it seemed like an impossible dream, but at the same time I felt 
            an impulse to explore the class as a possibility.</p>

            <section>
            <p>In my research of the class, I was surprised to discover that they were awarding 
            scholarships for the class tuition if one applied and had endorsements from parish
            clergy. One local priest wrote a recommendation letter for me, and not only did PATRAM
            give me full tuition, but they also paid for my airfare and my lodging at a local hotel!
            </p>
            <p>Before I knew it, I was in Moscow with my good friend, who had also applied for a 
            scholarship. Eight hours a day for an entire week, we practiced choral music, culminating
            being able to sing an entire vigil service on Saturday evening and a divine liturgy on 
            Sunday morning with members of the Moscow State Conservatory, in one of the ancient churches 
            of Russia's capital.

            Between all our classwork and rehearsals, we toured Moscow on foot, by cab, and via 
            the extensive subway system. The city itself was beautiful, fascinating, and vibrant. 
            There were so many different types of people, so many cultural monuments, and so many
            beautiful museums! One one block was a huge WWII museum. Down the street was a privately
            owned museum with the largest collection of Ethiopian religious imagery in the world, 
            outside of the African nation itself!

            The eight days in Moscow passed in a whirlwind, but the memories of the trip, the lessons
            from the music class, the experience of the music itself, and the friends I made, have all
            remained with me to this day.

               In fact, <a href="https://pravoslavie.ru/86454.html">I answered interview questions</a> 
               for an Orthodox website about my trip. I think perhaps my response to one question in 
               particular sums up the singing experience of my trip:
               <blockquote>
                  The goals, as I understood them, were to train a group of American musicians in the several 
                  pieces chosen, so that we actually sounded not only like a professional choir, but like a 
                  professional Russian Orthodox choir. I am in no position myself to judge this, but Maestro Gorbik 
                  told us afterwards that the monastery was very pleased with us. Others of the faithful in 
                  attendance also expressed their great appreciation. Maestro Gorbik himself also congratulated 
                  us on a job well done. This was enough for me.
