      <p>In 2015, I was a married father of three whose main hobby, other
      than home schooling, was singing in my acapella Russian Church choir. I had a love
      for all things Russian and musical, but my economic and family situation seemed to
      rule out any sort of excursion there for the foreseeable future.</p><br>

      <p>That fall, however, I learned of a Russian choral institute for Russian-American
      church singers called the Patriarch Tikhon Russian-American Music Institute 
      (<a href="https://patraminstitute.org/">PATRAM</a>),
      which held a masterclass in Moscow every year for church musicians. I was simultaneously
      elated and dejected: it seemed like an impossible dream, but at the same time I felt 
      an impulse to explore the class as a possibility.</p><br>
      <p>In my research of the class, I was surprised to discover that they were awarding 
      scholarships for the class tuition if one applied and had endorsements from parish
      clergy. One local priest wrote a recommendation letter for me, and not only did PATRAM
      give me full tuition, but they also paid for my airfare and my lodging at a local hotel!
      </p><br>
      <p>Before I knew it, I was in Moscow with my good friend, who had also applied for a 
         scholarship. Eight hours a day for an entire week, we practiced choral music, culminating
         being able to sing an entire vigil service on Saturday evening and a divine liturgy on 
         Sunday morning with members of the Moscow State Conservatory, in one of the ancient churches 
         of Russia's capital.

         Between all our classwork and rehearsals, we toured Moscow on foot, by cab, and via 
         the extensive subway system. The city itself was beautiful, fascinating, and vibrant. 
         There were so many different types of people, so many cultural monuments, and so many
         beautiful museums! One one block was a huge WWII museum. Down the street was a privately
         owned museum with the largest collection of Ethiopian religious imagery in the world, 
         outside of the African nation itself!
      </p><br>
      <p>
         The eight days in Moscow passed in a whirlwind, but the memories of the trip, the lessons
         from the music class, the experience of the music itself, and the friends I made, have all
         remained with me to this day.
